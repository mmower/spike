    @class      TDTokenizerState
    @brief      A <tt>TDTokenizerState</tt> returns a token, given a reader, an initial character read from the reader, and a tokenizer that is conducting an overall tokenization of the reader.
    @details    The tokenizer will typically have a character state table that decides which state to use, depending on an initial character. If a single character is insufficient, a state such as <tt>TDSlashState</tt> will read a second character, and may delegate to another state, such as <tt>TDSlashStarState</tt>. This prospect of delegation is the reason that the <tt>-nextToken</tt> method has a tokenizer argument.
